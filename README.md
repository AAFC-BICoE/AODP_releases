The Automated Oligoneucleotide Design Pipeline extracts signature oligonucleotides of specified lengths primarily using the program SigOli (Signature Oligo, Manuel Zahariev 2009). 
Signature oligonucleotides designed for hierarchically clustered taxon groups of interest, can be used 1) to construct DNA arrays for hybridization; or 2) for in silico probing of species with great accuracy from NGS databases.
